<i>"During my travels, a very important mask was stolen from me by an imp in the woods.<br> ... All I ask is that you also get back my precious mask that the imp stole from me.<br> ... Why, to someone like you, it should by no means be a difficult task.<br> Except... The one thing is... I'm a very busy fellow...And I must leave this place in three days.<br> How grateful I would be if you could bring it back to me before my time here is up..."<br>
— Happy Mask Salesman

The story of Majora's Mask is set in the "Child Link" Timeline after the events of Ocarina of Time. After the defeat of Ganondorf, Link is sent back in time so that he might relive his childhood.  Link began his adventure on horseback in the Lost Woods, he was in search of a friend who was very important and close. 
</p>
<p>

While traveling deep inside the Lost Woods, Link is ambushed and knocked off his horse by the Skull Kid, a strange imp wearing a peculiar mask, and his two friends, the fairies Tatl and Tael. The Skull Kid initially seems to recognize Link somehow, but quickly dismisses it, taking his Ocarina of Time. While the Skull Kid attempts to play the ocarina, Link comes to, and approaches the Skull Kid; he tries to lunge at the Skull Kid to reclaim his ocarina, but the imp quickly mounts Epona and takes off deep into the woods. Link is able to hold onto the Skull Kid's leg for a little while before being thrown off, attempting to give chase on foot instead. Given no option, Link follows them into an entryway leading into a large, hollow tree. Once inside, Link finds himself on the edge of a great hole, and is too late to save himself from falling into it.<br>
At the bottom of the hole, Link is confronted by the gloating Skull Kid, who claims he "got rid of" Link's horse. Using the evil powers of the mask, the Skull Kid then turns Link into a Deku Scrub. As the Skull Kid makes his exit, Tatl is separated from her brother, Tael, and has no choice but to ask Link's help in reuniting her with her companions. After navigating a complex of subterranean caves, Link meets the mysterious Happy Mask Salesman, who has the power to change him back into his true shape, though he is first required to retrieve his Ocarina of Time in order to do so. In exchange, he asks Link to retrieve Majora's Mask from the Skull Kid.
</p>

<p>
Exiting the caves, Link and Tatl find themselves in the middle of Clock Town, the geographical and economic center of Termina, a parallel world to Hyrule. They discover that they have arrived while the city is in full preparation for its annual festival, the Carnival of Time. Little by little, Link learns that a looming catastrophe is threatening the land: the Moon in the sky has assumed a horrible, evil face and has abandoned its orbit, instead traveling straight toward Termina. In three days, it will crash directly into Clock Town, presumably destroying all of Termina. <br>
With the third day almost up, Link finds the Skull Kid and retrieves the Ocarina of Time. Upon touching his precious instrument, Link is overcome by a memory of Princess Zelda teaching him the "Song of Time", remembering that the Goddess of Time will aid Link if he plays the song. Link learns from Tatl's brother, Tael, that in order to defeat the evil of Majora's Mask, he must travel to all four of the outlying regions of Termina and rescue "the four who are there," without much in the way of explanation. <br>
Left with no other option, Link and Tatl play the "Song of Time" as previously instructed, and is immediately thrown back to the morning that he first entered Clock Town, three days prior.<br><br>

</p>
<p>
Link heads back to the Happy Mask Salesman, who teaches him the "Song of Healing". Playing this song with the Ocarina of Time returns Link to his regular self, with the only remnants of his time as a Deku being a Mask, which he can don to become Deku Link once again. After aiding Link, the Mask Salesman asks that Link uphold his part of the bargain and return the Mask that the Skull Kid stole. <br>
Upon learning that Link could not recover the Mask, the Salesman grows furious, berating Link and wildly informing him that the Mask, known as Majora's Mask, is an ancient artifact that possesses an apocalyptic power. He again requests that Link recover the Mask, stating that he believes that Link can do it.
 Link then must awaken the four giants to prevent the Moon from falling and repeat the three days over and over until he succeeds. 
</p>
<p>
 After saving the Deku Princess and removing the poison from the Southern Swamp, bringing the Snowhead region back to spring, saving the Zora eggs and clearing the fog from Great Bay, and bringing peace to souls in Ikana Canyon, the giants that Link awakened stop the Moon from crashing into Termina, but it is revealed that Majora's Mask had possessed Skull Kid and it then gives more power to the moon. Link goes into the moon where he defeats Majora's Mask with the help of the Fierce Deity's Mask if he chooses to get it. Link then returns to Hyrule and continues his search for Navi.
