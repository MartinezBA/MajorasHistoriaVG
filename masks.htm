	You'll make the Gorman brothers on Milk Road very sad when you wear it around them (the looks on their faces are worth seeing!) Also while riding in the milk cart with Cremia at 6pm on the second day (if you saved Romani from the aliens the night before...) if you wear the mask, the bandits won't smash your milk, making it a much more enjoyable trip to the Milk Bar.<br><br>
