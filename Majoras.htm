The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was released in Japan in April 2000, in North America in October 2000, and in Europe in November 2000. The game is the sixth main installment in The Legend of Zelda series and the second using 3D graphics.
</p>
<p>
Majora's Mask plays very similar to Ocarina of Time, since many aspects of the first game on the Nintendo 64 were brought to the second one. However, Majora's Mask has a unique cycle of 3 days, in which the player has to travel back in time at the end right before the moon crashes into Termina. 
As soon as the player travels back in time, they lose certain items and progress they made during the last 3 days. Because of the 3 day mechanic, Majora's Mask is more time travel heavy than Ocarina of Time. In Ocarina of Time, the only time travel is between the future and the past, while in Majora's Mask, the player can go back to the beginning of the 3 days, slow down time, and fast forward to any point in the 3 day cycle.
Majora's Mask is also strange because the main quest is rather short. This is compensated however with the abundance of side quests found in the game. Many of these side quests reward Link with various kinds of masks. If Link obtains all the masks in the game, he is rewarded with the most powerful one in the game right before the final battle. Because of the power of the final mask, the final boss can either be the easiest or one of the most difficult in the Zelda series.

The game was rereleased also for the GameCube as part of The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition in 2003, for the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2009, and for the Wii U's Virtual Console service in 2016. An enhanced remake for the Nintendo 3DS, titled The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D, was released in February 2015.<br>
