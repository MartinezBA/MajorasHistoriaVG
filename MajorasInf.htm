<h1 align="center"> GAME DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL DATA </h1>	<!--COMPLETAR A PARTIR DE AQUI!-->
<p>
Majoras Mask is, by far, the darkest part of Zelda series. This game was developed re-using the engine and character models from Ocarina of Time wich reduced drastically the development time .<br>
<img src="imagenes/darkmoon.jpg" width="300" height="400" align="right">
Initially, Majoras Mask was thought as an expansion of Ocarina of Time(Ura Zelda). But Eiji Aonuma, current reponsible for the saga and part of development team by then, protested by appealing that the idea had potential for a completely new game.
Shigeru Miyamoto challenge him to create a new game within a year, so Ura Zelda would be cancelled. This is how Majoras Mask was born.<br>
Development team started to think how to create a game with so little time(after 3 years of Ocarina of Time development). It was then, when <b>Yoshiaki Koizumi</b> proposed the idea of the cycled of time and reuse resources. <br>
The original title of the game it was going to be Zelda Gaiden, and the player would have one week to save Termina, instead three days. The concept was improved when they saw that the idea was possible in fact.
</p>
<p>
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask runs on an upgraded version of the engine used in Ocarina of Time and requires the use of the 4 MB Expansion Pak. IGN theorizes this requirement is due to Majora's Mask's possible origin as a Nintendo 64DD game, which would necessitate an extra 4 MB of RAM.

The use of the Expansion Pak allows for greater draw distances, more accurate dynamic lighting, more detailed texture mapping and animation, complex framebuffer effects such as motion blur, and more characters displayed on-screen.<br>
This expanded draw distance allows the player to see much farther and eliminates the need for the fog effect and "cardboard panorama" seen in Ocarina of Time, which were used to obscure distant areas.IGN considered the texture design to be one of the best created for the Nintendo 64, saying that although some textures have a low resolution, they are "colorful and diverse", which gives each area "its own unique look".
