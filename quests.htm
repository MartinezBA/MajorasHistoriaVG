	<td align="center"><h6 align="left">Many of the events of the Anju & Kafei Quest are completely optional. 
Kafei fell in love with Anju, a girl whose family owned the Stock Pot Inn. They promised that in the early morning of their wedding day, both would merge their masks, the Mask of the Moon and the Sun, and thus create the Mask of the Bride and Groom as a blessing of their marriage. 
From there, you begin to know the story of Kafei, it turns out that shortly before their wedding, Skull Kid turned Kafei into a child. Scared, he decided to visit the great fairy in the Clock Town. However, Sakon appears, who steals his mask... <br><br>The mission begins from the first day, at the moment when Anju confuses you with another client and offers you a key to the inn. </h6></td>

	<td align="center"  valign="top"><h3 style="color:rgb(184,184,0)">Cremia and Romani</h3><br><img src="imagenes/cremiaromani.png"><br><br></td>
	<td align="center"><h6 align="left">At some point before dawn on the First Day, a giant stone is placed on the Milky Way, which causes the prevention of the delivery of milk from the ranch to the Milk Bar. 
The moment Link destroys the stone, you can start the mission. <br><br>However, the first thing to do is to prevent Romani and the ranch cows from being kidnapped by "Them"</h6></td>

	<td align="center"  valign="top"><h3 style="color:rgb(184,184,0)">Postman</h3><br><img src="imagenes/postman.png"></td>
	<td align="center"><h6 align="left"> The mission begins the moment you receive the letter for Kafei. From there, you join the missions
of Anju / Kafei and the postman. Link must put the letter in the mailbox and wait for the postman to take it to deliver it to its addressee.
As Kafei's location at that time is, in theory, totally unknown, you will have to follow him to find out where he is.
Once it has been achieved, there is nothing left but to wait for the last of the three days and deliver the "Special Delivery to Mama" to Madame Aroma, who, seeing that the postman has not yet fled, insists that he leave.
Once the mission is finished, Link receives the postman's hat.</h6></td>

	<td align="center"  valign="top"><h3 style="color:rgb(184,184,0)">Rosa Sisters</h3><br><img src="imagenes/rossass.png"></td>
	<td align="center"><h6 align="left"> Marilla and Judo. The twin sisters are the dancers of the Gorman Troupe visiting Clock Town to participate in the annual Carnival of Time. 
During the night, you meet them in the West of the Clock Town, practicing a dance. It's impossible to talk to them, unless you use Kamaro's mask. 
<br><br>When you wear the mask, you perform a mysterious dance ... that seems to fascinate the sisters. They quickly learn the dance steps and reward you with a Piece of Heart.</h6></td>

<tr>

	<td align="center"  valign="top"><h3 style="color:rgb(184,184,0)">Madame Aroma</h3><br><img src="imagenes/madamearoma.png"></td>
	<td align="center"><h6 align="left"> Madame Aroma is the wife of Mayor Dotour and the mother of Kafei. She gives Kafei's Mask and tells Link to talk to the people in the Clock Town using the mask to get information about her son. <br><br>
As we have explained before, the postman's mission unites both, because, once you receive Kafei's mask, the only thing left to do is deliver the "Special Delivery to Mama".
Which, by the way, can be done in two ways, by handing him the letter in person (and receiving a bottle of Chateau Romani) or by giving the letter to the postman.</h6></td>

	<td align="center"  valign="top"><h3 style="color:rgb(184,184,0)">Toto</h3><br><img src="imagenes/toto.png"></td>
	<td align="center"><h6 align="left"> Toto arrives at the Clock Town with the intention of speaking with Madame Aroma about the performance of the band at the Carnival of Time, and that a problem has arisen, Lulu, the singer of the band, has lost her voice. <br><br>Because of this, Toto must cancel the band's performance at the carnival, causing the presentation of the Gorman Company to be canceled as well.</h6></td>

	<td align="center"  valign="top"><h3 style="color:rgb(184,184,0)">Store manager</h3><br><img src="imagenes/curiosityman.png"></td>
	<td align="center"><h6 align="left"> A suspicious man. His shop only opens at night and sells stolen items. 
He is a trusted friend to Kafei and, thanks to him, you get the "Special Delivery to Mama" and the Keaton Mask. 
In the store you can buy (and sell) a variety of objects. Some of them are essential to complete the game. As for example, the All-Night Mask, or an Empty Bottle</h6></td>
